# Inaugural Speeches - Words and Emotions

## Introduction
Words have the power to make us feel happy, angry, curious, sad, loved, and a large list of other emotions. A right word in the right moment can change our lives or the course of history. In many ocassions, our emotions dictate our actions and shape our support or aversion towards certain things, people, sport teams, or policy positions. In April 2018, Michal Reifen-Tagar and Orly Idan, two researchers at the Interdisciplinary Centre Herzliya, in Israel, published the paper “A Rose by Any Other Name? A Subtle Linguistic Cue Impacts Anger and Corresponding Policy Support in Intractable Conflict”. In this study, by measuring the different levels of support and aversion to certain policies in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the authors concluded that a good way to use language to reduce tension is to rely, whenever possible, on nouns rather than verbs. The authors found support for the hypothesis that phrasing conflict-relevant policies in noun form (vs. verb form) would reduce anger and impact policy support correspondingly.

## Research Question
Inspired by the work of these academics, the following project aims to find differences between the firsts and seconds inaugural speeches of U.S. Presidents. Are there any substantive differences between these two speeches? Do different term speeches have different emotional content?

## Data
To perform this research I am going to use the U.S. Inaugural Speeches database. The only major modification that was done to it was the removal of the third and fourth term speeches of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the only U.S. President who have served more than two terms.
